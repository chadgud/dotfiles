# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles. They are a work in progress. 

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to manage the dotfiles. Each tool is divided into its own package so they can be installed separately.

## aerospace
[Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) is a tiling window mananger for macOS.

## neovim
My neovim config is based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), but moved from a single init.lua to a more organized folder structure.

## tmux
Simple tmux config with plugins managed using [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm).

## vim
Basic .vimrc if neovim is not available.

## scripts
Installation and setup scripts, as well as any other useful scripts.
